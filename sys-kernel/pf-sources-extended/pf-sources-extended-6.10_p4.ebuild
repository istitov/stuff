# 6.10 is a non-LTS kernel that reached end-of-life upstream (linux-stable
# stopped at 6.10.14). The trunk-pinned patches captured here track
# stable all the way to 6.10.14 — full coverage for this EOL branch.
#
# Per-branch judgment on 5xxx (genpatches "experimental" category):
#   * 5010_enable-cpu-optimizations-universal: NOT included. Same failure
#     mode as 6.9 — trunk's 5010 is calibrated against pf-flavored
#     vanilla rather than kernel.org pristine, hunk anchors don't match.
#     Dropping 5010 lets pf's arch/x86 fall into pf-only naturally so
#     the curated subset applies pf's full ISA Kconfig.
#   * 5020_BMQ-and-PDS-io-scheduler + 5021_BMQ-and-PDS-gentoo-defaults:
#     NOT included. Out of scope for the "minimal pf identity on
#     gentoo-sources" model.

DESCRIPTION="Linux kernel: gentoo-sources base + curated pf-kernel patchset"
HOMEPAGE="https://pfkernel.natalenko.name/
	https://dev.gentoo.org/~alicef/genpatches/"

# Per-slot snapshot of alicef's genpatches trunk for this branch,
# bundled into pf-genpatches-${SHPV}.tar.xz on the sister overlay
# extra-stuff (https://github.com/istitov/extra-stuff). Pinned by
# tag (-r70-1) so the URL is immutable; refreshing the snapshot
# means a new tag suffix. The original alicef trunk dir is a live
# working dir, so this bundle is the durable reference.
