# 6.15 is a non-LTS kernel that reached end-of-life upstream (linux-stable
# stopped at 6.15.12). genpatches' last bundle for this branch (-13)
# tracks stable through 6.15.11 — one stable release short of upstream
# EOL. ::gentoo no longer ships gentoo-sources-6.15.X, but alicef's
# release tarballs remain available on dev.gentoo.org, which is what
# this ebuild fetches.
